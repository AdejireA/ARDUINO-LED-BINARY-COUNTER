# Arduino LED Binary Counter

## Description
This project implements a binary counter using LEDs and an Arduino board. The LEDs represent the binary digits, counting up from 0 to 15 determined by the number of LEDs used.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LEDs (preferably different colors for better visualization)
- Resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
Include a schematic or a Fritzing diagram showing how the components are connected.

## Installation
1. Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch (`binary_counter.ino`) to your Arduino board.

## Usage
Once the sketch is uploaded, the binary counter will start counting automatically. You can observe the LEDs changing to represent the binary count.

## Customization
- Adjust the number of LEDs used in the circuit to change the maximum count value.
- Modify the Arduino sketch to change the counting speed or add additional features.
